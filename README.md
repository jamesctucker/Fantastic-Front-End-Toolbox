<!-- Learning Roadmap starts here -->

## **Learning Roadmap** <span id="LearningRoadmap"></span>

Many of the web developmnent roadmaps available online are arguably overwhelming to the beginner. Honestly, it's frightening to jump into a new thing and see a list of 150 niches to learn that each have their own dozen or so technologies to master.

So this one is intentionally **simple**.

1. Learn [HTML](#HTML) - makes the website structured
2. Learn [CSS](#CSS) - makes a website pretty
3. Learn [JavaScript](#JavaScript) - makes a website interactive
4. Learn a [framework](#JavaScriptFrameworks) - arguably makes development time shorter and less painful; good options include Vue, Svelte, and React.
5. Learn the backend: gets the website's data and content; you don't necessarily have to master the backend - but it's helpful, and often desired by employers, for frontend developers to know how to hook up the frontend to the backend. Options include Node.js (which is JavaScript), Ruby on Rails, Java, or Python.

Throughout your entire journey, make sure you build things if want to retain your knowledge.

Make your motto **ABB** - Always Be Building!

<!-- Comprehensive curriculums start here -->

## **Comprehensive Curriculum** <span id="ComprehensiveCurriculum"></span>

> If you've decided to commit to self-learning, the following two curriculums are absolutely free, widely-respected, and cover the entire web development stack - from frontend to backend. My personal opinion is that you should choose one of these to avoid tutorial hell/lack of direction, and supplement with other videos/courses/articles.

- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - a free, open-source platform for learning full-stack development. There are several 300-hour courses on subjects such as front-end development, data structures, and passing code interviews. Each course completion comes with a certificate.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) - a free, open-source curriculum for learning web development. Courses on JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS. This curriculum requires you to utilize many external resources, so you'll become proficient at setting up your own coding environment and searching for valuable resources online.
